# PWMDriver
Development of PWMDriver modules - simplified structure to allow for versatile PWM control under interrupts.

I have a couple of projects with a PWM structure which provides for groups of PWMs to be operated in concert. This structure integrates
a more versatile structure allowing for programming of groups of PWMs with different characteristics. My goal is to set up so that I can run servos,
light driving, audio through the same driver structure.

So far so good - it is pulsing the on-board LED.
